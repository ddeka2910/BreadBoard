=head1 NAME

Bread::Board::Container::Parameterized - A parameterized container

=head1 VERSION

version 0.35

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements a sort of container factory for L<Bread::Board>:
a parameterized container is a, in practice, a function from a set of
parameters (which must be containers) to an actual container. See
L<Bread::Board::Manual::Example::FormSensible> for an example.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<name>

Read/write string, required. Every container needs a name, by which it
can be referenced when L<fetching it|Bread::Board::Traversable/fetch>.

=head2 C<allowed_parameter_names>

Read-only arrayref of strings, required. These are the names of the
containers that must be passed to L<< C<create>|create ( %params ) >>
to get an actual container out of this parameterized object.

=head2 C<container>

This attribute holds the "prototype" container. Services inside it can
depend on service paths that include the container names given in
L</allowed_parameter_names>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<add_service>

=head2 C<get_service>

=head2 C<has_service>

=head2 C<get_service_list>

=head2 C<has_services>

=head2 C<add_sub_container>

=head2 C<get_sub_container>

=head2 C<has_sub_container>

=head2 C<get_sub_container_list>

=head2 C<has_sub_containers>

All these methods are delegated to the "prototype" L</container>, so
that this object can be defined as if it were a normal container.

=head2 C<create>

  my $container = $parameterized_container->create(%params);

After checking that the keys of C<%params> are exactly the same
strings that are present in L</allowed_parameter_names>, this method
clones the prototype L</container>, adds the C<%params> to the clone
as sub-containers, and returns the clone.

If this was not a top-level container, the parent is also cloned, and
the container clone is added to the parent clone.

Please note that the container returned by this method does I<not>
have the same name as the parameterized container, and that calling
this method with different parameter values will return different
containers, but all with the same name. It's probably a bad idea to
instantiate a non-top-level parameterized container more than once.

=head2 C<fetch>

=head2 C<resolve>

These two methods die, since services in a parameterized container
won't usually resolve, and attempting to do so is almost always a
mistake.
